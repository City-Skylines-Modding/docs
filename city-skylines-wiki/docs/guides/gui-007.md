# Creating a new mod

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a new mod for Cities: Skylines. It will cover the basics of creating a new mod by referencing the Unlimited Money mod from the Game.

## Steps

1. Set up your development environment using the [Development Environment](../development/environment-setup.md) guide.
2. Create a new file with the name of your mod in the `Source` folder. For example, `InfiniteResources.cs`. For simplicity, we will use a single file for the mod's logic. In a real-world scenario, you would create a new folder for your mod and split the logic into multiple files.
3. Add the following code to your new file.

   This code implements the `IUserMod` interface, which is required for all mods. It provides the name and description of the mod that will be displayed in the game's `Content Manager`.

   ```csharp
   using ICities;
   using UnityEngine;

   namespace UnlimitedMoney.source
   {
     public class UnlimitedMoney : IUserMod
     {
       public string Name => "Unlimited Money";
       public string Description => "Adds unlimited money to the game.";
     }
   }
   ```

4. Create the class that will handle the mod's logic.

   This code implements the `EconomyExtensionBase` class, which is used to modify the game's economy system. It overrides the `OnUpdateMoneyAmount` method to set the player's budget to the maximum value and the `OnPeekResource` method to allow the player to peek at any amount of resources.

   ```csharp
   public class UnlimitedMoney : EconomyExtensionBase
   {
     public override long OnUpdateMoneyAmount(long budget)
     {
       return long.MaxValue;
     }

     public override bool OverrideDefaultPeekResource
     {
       get { return true; }
     }

     public override int OnPeekResource(EconomyResource resource, int amount)
     {
       return amount;
     }
   }
   ```

5. Build the project by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + B` in Visual Studio.
6. Copy the generated `dll` file from the `bin` folder to the `Mods` folder in the game's installation directory.
7. Start the game and enable the mod in the `Content Manager`.
8. Enjoy your new mod!s
