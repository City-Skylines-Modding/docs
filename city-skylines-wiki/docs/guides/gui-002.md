# Setting Up SSH Key for Git

## Introduction

This guide will show you how to set up an SSH key for Git, enabling you to authenticate with Git repositories without entering your username and password every time.

## Generate SSH Key

### Windows

1. **Open Git Bash**: Launch Git Bash from your Start menu.
2. **Generate SSH Key**: Run the following command, replacing `your_email@email.com` with your actual email address:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@email.com"
   ```

3. **Save the Key**: Press Enter to accept the default file location (`/c/Users/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa`).
4. **Enter a Passphrase**: Type a secure passphrase to protect your SSH key. Remember this passphrase as it will be needed to use your key.

### Linux & macOS

1. **Open Terminal**: Launch a terminal window.
2. **Generate SSH Key**: Run the following command, replacing `your_email@email.com` with your actual email address:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@email.com"
   ```

3. **Save the Key**: Press Enter to accept the default file location (`/home/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa` on Linux or `/Users/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa` on macOS).
4. **Enter a Passphrase**: Type a secure passphrase to protect your SSH key. Remember this passphrase as it will be needed to use your key.

## Add SSH Key to SSH Agent

### Windows

1. **Start the SSH Agent**: In Git Bash, run:

   ```bash
   eval $(ssh-agent -s)
   ```

2. **Add Your SSH Key**: Run the following command:

   ```bash
   ssh-add /c/Users/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

### Linux & macOS

1. **Start the SSH Agent**: In a terminal, run:

   ```bash
   eval $(ssh-agent -s)
   ```

2. **Add Your SSH Key**: Run the following command:

   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

## Adding SSH Key to Your Git Hosting Service

### GitHub

1. **Copy Your SSH Key**: Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

2. **Add SSH Key to GitHub**:
   - Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **SSH and GPG keys** > **New SSH key**.
   - Paste your SSH key into the "Key" field and add a descriptive title.
   - Click **Add SSH key**.

### GitLab

1. **Copy Your SSH Key**: Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

2. **Add SSH Key to GitLab**:
   - Go to GitLab and log in to your account.
   - Navigate to **Profile settings** > **SSH Keys**.
   - Paste your SSH key into the "Key" field and add a descriptive title.
   - Click **Add key**.

## Testing SSH Connection

1. **Test the SSH Connection**: Run the following command to verify that your SSH key is set up correctly:

   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

   or for GitLab:

   ```bash
   ssh -T git@gitlab.com
   ```

If successful, you should see a message indicating that authentication was successful.
