# Pull Request Standards

## Introduction

In this document, you will learn how to create a pull request for any City Skylines repository. Pull requests are a way to propose changes to the repository maintained by the City Skylines Wiki team. By following the steps outlined in this document, you will be able to create a pull request that will be reviewed by the maintainers of the repository.

## Steps to Create a Pull Request

Follow these steps to create a pull request for a City Skylines repository:

1. Create a new pull request by clicking on the "New pull request" button on the repository page.
2. Select the base branch and compare branch for your pull request. The base branch is the branch you want to merge your changes into, and the compare branch is the branch that contains your changes.
3. Review the changes in the pull request and ensure they are correct.
4. Add a title and description to your pull request. The title should be concise and describe the changes you are proposing.
5. Assign reviewers to your pull request. Reviewers are responsible for reviewing the changes and providing feedback.
6. Add labels to your pull request to categorize it. Labels help maintainers understand the nature of the changes being proposed.
7. Submit your pull request by clicking on the "Create pull request" button. Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers of the repository.

## Pull Request Review Process

Once you have submitted a pull request, it will go through a review process before it is merged into the repository. The review process consists of the following steps:

1. Reviewers will review the changes in the pull request and provide feedback.
2. Reviewers may request changes to be made to the pull request before it can be merged.
3. Once the changes have been made, the pull request will be re-reviewed by the reviewers.
4. If the pull request is approved, it will be merged into the repository.
