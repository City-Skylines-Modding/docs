# Commit Message Standards

## What is a Commit?

A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. It records changes to your files, allowing you to track the history of your project and collaborate with others.

## Types of Commits

1. **feat**: A new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script.
2. **fix**: A bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script.
3. **docs**: Changes to the documentation only.
4. **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
5. **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
6. **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
7. **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests.
8. **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation.

## Commit Message Format

`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

- `<type>`: The type of the commit (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`).
- `<scope>`: The scope of the commit (e.g., `develop`, `master`).
- `<subject>`: A concise description of the commit.

## Breaking Change

If your commit introduces a breaking change that will affect users, include `BREAKING_CHANGE` in the commit message. This helps users understand the impact of the change and take necessary actions to update their code.

Example with Breaking Change:

```git
feat(develop): Added new feature to API

BREAKING_CHANGE: This commit introduces a breaking change to the API's response format.
```
