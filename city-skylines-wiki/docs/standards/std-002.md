# Branch Naming Standard

## Types of a Branch

1. **feat**: A new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script.
2. **fix**: A bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script.
3. **docs**: Changes to the documentation only.
4. **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
5. **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
6. **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
7. **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests.
8. **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation.

## Branch Naming Format

Each branch name consists of

- a **type**,
- a **scope**,
- and a **subject**.

```{text}
<type>/<scope>-<subject>
```

If it is a change, it should be prefixed with the type of change it contains. If it is a feature, it should be prefixed with the type of feature it contains.

## Branch Naming Examples

Here are some examples of branch names following the branch naming format:

```bash
feat/documentation-update-fix
```

```bash
fix/automatic-bulldozer
```

```bash
chore/update-dependencies
```
